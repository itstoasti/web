The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Scrapy**: This is the main dependency for all the files in the `web_scraper` directory. It's a Python framework for web scraping that provides all the functionality needed for scraping websites, such as handling requests, parsing responses, and storing data.

2. **RedditSpider**: This is the main class that will be used in the `reddit_spider.py` file. It will also be referenced in the `scrapy.cfg` file to specify the spider to run.

3. **Item**: This is a class defined in the `items.py` file that represents the data to be scraped. It will be used in the `reddit_spider.py` file to define the data to extract, and in the `pipelines.py` file to process the scraped data.

4. **Pipeline**: This is a class defined in the `pipelines.py` file that processes the scraped data. It will be used in the `settings.py` file to enable the pipeline, and in the `reddit_spider.py` file to send the scraped data to the pipeline.

5. **Middleware**: This is a class defined in the `middlewares.py` file that handles requests and responses. It will be used in the `settings.py` file to enable the middleware.

6. **Settings**: This is a module defined in the `settings.py` file that contains settings for the Scrapy project. It will be used in the `scrapy.cfg` file to specify the settings module for the project.

7. **GUI**: This is the main class that will be used in the `main.py` file in the `gui` directory. It will also be referenced in the `__init__.py` file in the `gui` directory to make it available as a module.

8. **JSON**: This is the format in which the scraped data will be stored. It will be used in the `pipelines.py` file to serialize the data, and in the `main.py` file in the `gui` directory to load the data into the GUI.

9. **DOM Elements**: The specific DOM elements to be scraped will be defined in the `reddit_spider.py` file. These might include elements like post titles, author names, and timestamps.

10. **Pagination and Dynamic Content**: The functionality to handle pagination and dynamic content will be implemented in the `reddit_spider.py` file. This might involve following links to next pages and handling JavaScript-loaded content.
